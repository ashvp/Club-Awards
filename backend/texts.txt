how to group clubs??
    - we get the club name, and what they stand for, like omnia is community, rhythm is dance, 
    ameya is classical dance, etc.. so i could grp rhythm and ameya together under dance clubs, 
    or even a broader category like entertainment club, along with atwas (theatre) and film club.
    - grouping can be done by an llm?? or some rule based algorithm or a ml to determine the key word
    and bring it under an umbrella term, like dim reduction techniques - K-means is good ig, i'll scrape 
    from SNUC website..
        * used sentence embeddings to to vectorise and then used DBSCAN to group them.. 
        tuned hyper-parameter to work for my manual data.. 
        now have to figure out a way to either scrape the data from a website or somewhere..
            ! cannot scrape data because cloudflare is blocking it
            so im DROPPING web scraper to get the clubs.. let's just go with manual way, its too late now..
        
        ? Now thinking of Outlook mails, because all official communications is through that, 
        so any recognised event would be communicated through that.
            > cannot use Azure APIs since they are not allowed for students by my organisations. (Entra)
            so for the sake of simplicity, im exporting all mails as csv and then filtering whats needed.
        * forwarded all mail from 2025 to my personal mail, downloaded as zip and saved as .eml files with content..
