28/07/25, 15:32 - +91 96771 96957: Update: TEST WILL HAPPEN TODAY. 

Links will be sent out at 4pm.

I understand this sucks because you will have to miss the bus without context on wether or not you are shortlisted

But we tried our best to get the list. It seems like sourcing the list right now would take longer than 4pm <This message was edited>

2. Didn't get link at all

28/07/25, 20:46 - +91 96771 96957: I heard that there has been information that has circulated that only people who were on the list, but didn't attend the test today, will be able to attend it at 830am tomorrow.

This is false 

Only people affected in the below criteria will be allowed to attend:
1. Shortlist issues: intermixing between SSN and snu lists
2. Platform issues: name was on the list, but didn't get mail
3. Anticheat issues: wrongly blocked out by anticheat false positives
4. Delayed resolutions: those who got above issues resolved very late and didn't have ample time to take the test properly.

There will be no other case where retaking in the morning tomorrow will be permitted.

23/08/25, 19:57 - +91 99401 34797: Rule of thumb

If you're not doing something more useful outside class than the lecture itself, better to sit through the lecture <This message was edited>

31/08/25, 20:54 - +91 95977 74031: Any particular softwares that need to be installed in our laptops for tmr's workshop?
31/08/25, 20:56 - +91 72043 97677: maybe get a bootable version of a pentesting specialized operating system like kali/parrot. or atleast get a version of linux ready (maybe WSL)
31/08/25, 20:56 - +91 72043 97677: but there's no hard requirements
31/08/25, 20:56 - Vijayan Cybersecurity: WSL should be enough.
31/08/25, 20:56 - +91 99806 96238: This, I'd personally recommend WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux.
31/08/25, 20:58 - +91 95977 74031: Thanks

31/08/25, 22:03 - +91 99402 55513: WSL?
31/08/25, 22:03 - +91 99402 55513: Ive had enuf trauma with wsl
31/08/25, 22:03 - +91 95003 22609: what did bro run into
31/08/25, 22:04 - +91 99402 55513: I wld say, dont use wsl unless you really know your shit
31/08/25, 22:04 - Prajesh AI and DS: it's literally just clicking a few buttons-
31/08/25, 22:04 - +91 99402 55513: Everything is fine until u have to uninstall it
31/08/25, 22:04 - +91 95003 22609: microsoft ☕
31/08/25, 22:04 - +91 99402 55513: 😭
31/08/25, 22:05 - Prajesh AI and DS: just...uninstall? 😭 I've uninstalled it before, am I missing something?
31/08/25, 22:05 - Aditya SNU 3rd year: Wsl peak though, legit peak engineering
31/08/25, 22:05 - Vijayan Cybersecurity: can confirm
31/08/25, 22:05 - Prajesh AI and DS: if only wsa received similar love 😔
31/08/25, 22:05 - +91 99402 55513: No the thing is it got integrated with vs code for some reason and in first year i had no clue what was happening and was legit freaking out
31/08/25, 22:06 - +91 99402 55513: Real but using wsl without knowing how to, is kinda hard
31/08/25, 22:06 - +91 95003 22609: you just have to uninstall the wsl vscode extension
31/08/25, 22:06 - Prajesh AI and DS: sir you had a project in the wsl directories then
31/08/25, 22:06 - +91 95003 22609: unless you installed vsc within wsl or smth
31/08/25, 22:06 - +91 99402 55513: I did da
31/08/25, 22:06 - Aditya SNU 3rd year: Didn't... wsa get discontinued
31/08/25, 22:06 - +91 99402 55513: Yes
31/08/25, 22:06 - Prajesh AI and DS: yes 😔
31/08/25, 22:08 - Prajesh AI and DS: Microsoft should've bit the bullet and begged google for google play integration
31/08/25, 22:08 - Prajesh AI and DS: having amazon app store as the only way for normal consumers to install apps, plus the complexity of installing it as a regular user killed it mainly <This message was edited>

31/08/25, 22:10 - +91 94440 41895: Wait at that point isn't it easier to use
31/08/25, 22:10 - +91 94440 41895: Vms
31/08/25, 22:10 - +91 94440 41895: Instead of struggling with windows
31/08/25, 22:10 - +91 95003 22609: they _are_ vms
31/08/25, 22:10 - +91 94440 41895: Oh
31/08/25, 22:10 - +91 94440 41895: Alr
31/08/25, 22:11 - +91 93612 41992: what you on about, wsl quite literally beginner shit
31/08/25, 22:11 - +91 93612 41992: better than VMs if you don't have the memory or dual boot
31/08/25, 22:12 - +91 94440 41895: Wait so if you use wsl can you install packages and all that normally?
31/08/25, 22:12 - +91 94440 41895: Or is there extra steps
31/08/25, 22:12 - +91 93612 41992: you just connected vsc to remote wsl 😭
you open vsc on a local folder and it goes away :/
31/08/25, 22:13 - +91 95003 22609: yeah?
31/08/25, 22:13 - +91 95003 22609: and if you're wsl2 (which you most likely are) you can use linux gui apps too
31/08/25, 22:13 - +91 94440 41895: Thanks
31/08/25, 22:13 - +91 94440 41895: I'm not asking for me bro

31/08/25, 22:19 - +91 98400 20605: Nix is one of the best distros 🙏
31/08/25, 22:20 - +91 98400 20605: and by Light which parameter are you referring to?
31/08/25, 22:20 - +91 95003 22609: this tbh, light is pretty subjective
31/08/25, 22:20 - +91 95003 22609: arch is just minimal ootb; and not the only distro out there that is minimal
31/08/25, 22:20 - +91 94440 41895: Well by light I meant what didnt have as many background processes
31/08/25, 22:20 - +91 98400 20605: Yeah but let's just assume he is referring to Memory Consumption when the system is Idle
31/08/25, 22:21 - +91 94440 41895: That took up ram
31/08/25, 22:21 - +91 95003 22609: heck it isn't even the most minimal if you wanna go by that metric
31/08/25, 22:21 - +91 95003 22609: I ran debian with kde on a dabba from 2013 with 4 gigs of ddr3 <This message was edited>
31/08/25, 22:21 - Prajesh AI and DS: For most people, light is something lighter than windows, and the safest option where everything works is ubuntu imo
31/08/25, 22:21 - +91 98400 20605: Vanilla Debian is OP <This message was edited>
