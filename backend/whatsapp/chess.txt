14/10/23, 23:18 - +91 73387 12142: Hey hi guys, we got quite a few queries so just putting a few key points out here.
We'll be sending out a form where you'd have to fill in some details and your FIDE rating. Those with the highest rating can form the team and register.
Regarding any tests around that time, you would have to talk to your faculty and figure out when you can take it. It's between you and the respective faculty. 
And most importantly, expenses will have to completely be borne by you, our university won't sponsor it nor will SNU Noida give any reimbursement
