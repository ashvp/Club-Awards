[25/08/2024, 2:57:47 PM] ~ Narendra S: Alien: Romulus


While hitting most of the beats we've come to expect from an alien movie, it also adds a bit of nuance to the franchise.

The visuals are amazing as expected from an installment of the alien franchise, it has brought back some of the more claustrophobic and dark elements that made the original alien movie so great.
It also does amazing work with the alien itself, it looks great and is terrifying as ever. And as for the wide shots of the spaceship along with the Jackson colony with it's beautiful saturn-esque rings, every single one of them is absouletly stunning to look at.
The soundtrack makes you feel the absolute terror of being chased by half a dozen xenomorphs or a bajillion facehuggers, the film did not let me down musically or visually.


*(Spoilers ahead)*

What I like most about this movie is that it doesn't (solely) rely on the same old tropes that we've seen in the previous alien movies.

1. The protagonists are not scientists, marines or colonists, they are just regular people who are trying to escape the grasp of the Wayland corp. and survive.

2. They are a lot quicker to come up with ideas on how to immobilize/disable/attack the xenomorphs/facehuggers. e.g freezing the tail of the facehugger, disabling the ships gravity generators to avoid the xenomorph's (acidic) blood leaking through the floor and creating a hole in the ship, partly due to the next point.

3. The protagonists are not kept in the dark about what's about to happen, thanks to Rook (and Andy, via Rook's module), and are able to prepare for the worst, unlike in previous movies where the main characters had no idea what was coming.

4. Although the human-xenomorph hybrid? was a bit funky looking visually, it was a nice twist to the story and added a bit of originality to the movie.

My one complaint with the movie is that it didn't use the enormous amount of facehuggers that were shown in the beginning of the movie, they only come up twice. Although admittedly it would have been very hard to use them to the fullest extent without increasing the runtime of the movie, and it's not like they just disappeared, they tie up the loose ends by showing that the facehuggers were locked off from the rest of the ship in both cases.

[02/10/2024, 6:07:44 PM] ~ Narendra S: They leaned away from it in the marketing but it was obviously a musical
[02/10/2024, 6:17:37 PM] ~ Narendra S: Most of the bad reviews that go into detail complain about the musical bit, a couple about no action scenes, only real complaint I found was 3 of them saying the story had no point to it, and didn't live up to the original.

[02/10/2024, 11:04:38 PM] ~ Pravin: It’s a bad movie
[02/10/2024, 11:04:59 PM] ~ rakesh_sudharsan1831: 🤡
[02/10/2024, 11:05:15 PM] ~ Vaibhav: ouch
[02/10/2024, 11:06:19 PM] ~ Pravin: A musical that doesn’t commit to the genre, a courtroom drama that is so badly distracted and a character study that confuses the audience more than build any sort of personality to arthur whose character has already been 100% explored in the first movie
[02/10/2024, 11:10:05 PM] ~ Pravin: ( but mind blowing work on the visuals really have to appreciate that )
[02/10/2024, 11:13:50 PM] ~ Prithwin: No.

[03/10/2024, 7:11:57 PM] ~ Prithwin: What you guys actually think about it ?
[03/10/2024, 7:12:00 PM] ~ rakesh_sudharsan1831: You were the only one with the positive review
[03/10/2024, 7:12:28 PM] ~ Prithwin: I had an argument yesterday with my frnd on the ending of the movie
[03/10/2024, 7:12:48 PM] ~ Prithwin: 😂😭 I have the clip to prove i was right
[03/10/2024, 7:12:58 PM] ~ Prithwin: So i wanna have a discussion with people who saw it
[03/10/2024, 7:14:44 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: +1. It’s definitely not for everybody, but telling it’s not a piece of art is not possible.
[03/10/2024, 7:17:58 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: Here’s my take. If you enjoyed Joaquin Phoenix in the first part. Part 2 is a must watch. You like artistic cinematography and production design, must watch.
If you are neutral about musicals, not for you.
If you value writing a lot, it’s ambiguous.
[03/10/2024, 7:18:44 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: I agree. WB is the real culprit
[03/10/2024, 7:19:10 PM] ~ Prithwin: dei people who can actually enjoy la la land why cant they enjoy this
[03/10/2024, 7:19:30 PM] ~ Prithwin: idhula the songs had story in it
[03/10/2024, 7:19:58 PM] ~ rakesh_sudharsan1831: The only music for joker is phonk
[03/10/2024, 7:20:05 PM] ~ Prithwin: and it only came when he wants to open his heart and express feelings about Harley quinn
[03/10/2024, 7:20:17 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: Actually yeah. But the magnitude may cause some to not like.
[03/10/2024, 7:20:21 PM] ~ Prithwin: plus until the end he says story
[03/10/2024, 7:20:32 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: *spoilers?
[03/10/2024, 7:20:50 PM] ~ Prithwin: no not really
[03/10/2024, 7:21:13 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: Ok
[03/10/2024, 7:22:44 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: In my opinion, Todd Phillips(director) tried something very unique and risky with the character. You got to respect that. ‎<This message was edited>
[03/10/2024, 7:24:35 PM] ~ Pravin: La la land was a full and full musical
[03/10/2024, 7:24:44 PM] ~ Pravin: With amazing music
[03/10/2024, 7:24:57 PM] ~ Pravin: Even the piano has so much emotion to it
[03/10/2024, 7:25:11 PM] ~ Pravin: Joker 2’s musical pieces didn’t even come close
[03/10/2024, 7:25:17 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: You definitely can’t compare it to la la land
[03/10/2024, 7:25:58 PM] ~ Pravin: Not one song or performance stayed in my mind after the movie ended
[03/10/2024, 7:26:08 PM] ~ Pravin: It failed as a musical
[03/10/2024, 7:26:47 PM] ~ Prithwin: dei its not enjoyable
[03/10/2024, 7:26:49 PM] ~ Prithwin: do u get it
[03/10/2024, 7:27:16 PM] ~ Pravin: It doesn’t have to be enjoyable to leave an impact
[03/10/2024, 7:27:24 PM] ~ Pravin: This left 0 impact
[03/10/2024, 7:27:24 PM] ~ Prithwin: dei

[03/10/2024, 7:27:51 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: It definitely had story. But some of the music could’ve been done better.

[03/10/2024, 7:30:01 PM] ~ Prithwin: full movie la sj suryah is a delu delu guy where when he wants to express it goes to the stage where he sings a song alone and the audience are the ones who he wants to be with
[03/10/2024, 7:30:42 PM] ~ Prithwin: these songs weren't supposed to be the ones you have to enjoy you are getting into the mind of Arthur
[03/10/2024, 7:31:00 PM] ~ Prithwin: on how he portrays things
[03/10/2024, 7:31:25 PM] ~ Prithwin: the songs where which happened in irl with Harley is diff from the one he plays in his head
[03/10/2024, 7:31:58 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: Let me see if I understand this. It’s like Arthur having bad jokes in joker because let’s face it he was a bad comedian. So in this his musical taste isn’t that great hence the music is average?
[03/10/2024, 7:32:16 PM] ~ Prithwin: you cant expect to have a better music from a broken guy who is trying to build his own fantasy within his head ‎<This message was edited>

[03/10/2024, 7:47:46 PM] ~ Pravin: The joker was a bold figure that gave people courage to revolt against the officials. It gave arthur a purpose in his horrid life.

[03/10/2024, 7:51:13 PM] ~ Pravin: What im saying is either make a gripping comic inspired thriller/character study or make a good musical tragedy
[03/10/2024, 7:52:00 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: Well it got tragedy somewhat right
[03/10/2024, 7:52:14 PM] ~ Prithwin: this movie is literally about aruthur when he looses himself and meets a girl who liked him for who he was and bro wants to embrace it and when he tries to be the real him you know the end

[10/10/2024, 8:49:25 PM] ~ Prithwin: @⁨~Saeshwaran⁩ 30 mins ah uve been typing 😭
[10/10/2024, 8:51:19 PM] ~ Saeshwaran: My take is this:
*spoilers*










The film in my opinion was greedy. Tried to pack too many things into a 2:45min runtime. The story was great, but the problem was that there was too many great stories, so the screenplay rightly couldn’t balance them and do them justice. The film is about encounter vs trial, education system amongst other things. Plus there were a ton of characters. The movie never balances any of them or give the depth they deserved, except Fafa perhaps. One of my biggest complaints about the film is Anirudh’s music. I like Anirudh a lot and have really enjoyed his recent works, but in this movie he never seems to be quiet, so I was relieved whenever there weren’t any score, all of the dramatic scenes were over shadowed by the score. As far as Rajinism goes this movie takes the middle ground, which it didn’t have to. The style moments except a few felt forced. The screenplay relies heavily on media, but I could see that they didn’t know how to work such scripts. It definitely doesn’t mean it was a bad film. It had some really unique and interesting scenes.   My favourite was the assault scene, adding the POV shot really elevated the amount of tension in the scene, sort of giving a “Predator” vibe to the sequence. It also plays into the story in a great way. Another great decision is to keep “Manasilaayo” at the beginning.  The cinematography was great at some sequences. 
Overall I wouldn’t recommend watching this movie more than once because it’s quite a drag with a little bit of good scenes sprinkled here and there. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/10/2024, 9:11:23 PM] ~ Sree Sai Raghav: Adding on to ur view on Rajinism,, I personally didn't feel that to be forced. The film with such a long runtime and a wide approach, shld definitely have a gripping screenplay and that pace was well maintained by adding those style moments. There goes a few scenes in the second half with a bit of lag and there the director spices it up with the Rajinism! That is what fans need! I would say this film was perfect for Superstar cauz at times where u think about logic or lag, Thalaivar style just makes u forget it, and that's what it's required to carry on the storyline

[16/11/2024, 11:35:39 AM] ~ Senthil  🫶🏻💛: Watched Kanguva fully !
This is my review with some spoilers !!!!!

1. The movie has actually very good story of past and reincarnation.
2. The thing is present scenes didn't stick to the story and feels like different plot due to unwanted cringe and "so called" comedy scenes.
3. The present didn't actually show the character of Francis .... They didn't show depth of his character....if they have shown it , we would have somewhat got connected with him ... But we don't feel anything when he gets hurt or happy when he wins the final fight on cargo plane 
4. Also the character writing is the small boy Poduva didn't work out ....Though he has more scenes than most the characters , the director failed to give him a character depth .... We don't feel sad when he gets fever or crying about his family....maybe if we got more scenes of Koduva and Poduva , we might have known how important was family to him , they missed that chance .... 
5. Also they show more than 50 mins of Kanguva and Poduva duo , but still they don't deliver any impact on us during climax when Kanguva tries to save Poduva
6. Also Poduva felt that much irritating and during that mannipu song visuals , we feel like why can't Kanguva just finish off that idiotic boy (which is opposite to the real core idea of those scenes )
7. We should have got feel like Bahubali and Kattapa like duo but we got their 144p version with too many flaws
8. Now about the Aintheevu , the visuals looks so good and the costumes were also nice .
9. About Perumaachi Girls fight , it should have been like Agent Tina Fight in Vikram but instead they literally spoiled it by showing Kanguva for each fight moves which makes us feel another fight of kanguva is happening.
10. If they have only shown The girls fighting , it would have been such an iconic scene of the movie .
11. Next to the music , honestly some bgms were really good from DSP but he overdosed it during some important scenes which made many people ear pain.
12. Also Karthi Cameo was Nice and guess what ? His backstory said only by voiceovers made much impact in audience than poduva story which has occupied most part of the movie.
13. Positive Things - Story,Visuals and Some characters (Kanguva,Karunas, Women team of Perumachi and Bose Venkat ) and Karthi Cameo
15. Negative Things - Dialogues and Shouting , Logic mistakes (plenty) , Present Scenes Fully , Poduva Character(no impact created in audience) and Unnecessary Songs.
16. Both positive and negative - Music(as I said before) and Fights (some fights were really good but many are logicless)
17. Overall Review : Kanguva can be 1 time watchable if we ignore logic mistakes and shouting. ‎<This message was edited>

[16/11/2024, 7:52:23 PM] ~ Dev Sai: @⁨~AK~⁩ Gladiator was a huge success in Tamilnadu (many are fans for the tamil dub) 
Maybe because of kanguva release and amaran replacing it's shows this is happening ‎<This message was edited>

[25/12/2024, 2:01:19 PM] ~ GKS: I watched marco, the story is just a typical gangster story, but the way they have taken it with such a small budget is pretty impressive. The screenplay, cinematography, Unni Mukundan's efforts for the movie, especially the fights, and especially music were all too good.  Kandipa worth watching in theatre, I would say th ehype is justified. It will completely satisfy you if you like extremely violent films. One of the most violent Indian films for sure, please don't take family members  if they can't handle violence,. There are some cinematic masala stuff in the movie but it is pretty forgivable

⏳ Deadline: 22nd July 2025

Hey there, fellow film nerds and creative weirdos 🎥✨

The SNU Film Club – Montage is officially assembling its next Core Committee and guess what? We want you (yes, you with the Letterboxd addiction and 100+ GB of downloaded movies).

If you’ve got big ideas, a love for all things cinema, and a knack for getting things done (or at least pretending to), this is your time to shine.

🍿 What’s in it for you?

Creative Control: Help decide what we watch, make, and do all year long.

Event Shenanigans: Host screenings, discussions, meme nights, and possibly chaotic film fests.

Squad Goals: Collaborate with a bunch of equally obsessed, slightly unhinged film lovers.

Legacy Vibes: Leave behind more than just popcorn crumbs — leave a mark.


📌 Ready to join the fun?
Fill out the form, bring your passion (and your favorite movie recs):
👉 https://forms.office.com/r/GJguFdZnxh

Let’s make Montage the coolest, quirkiest club on campus.
Lights. Camera.*Apply*. 🎞️

Cheers,
SNU Film Club – Montage 🍿🎬
