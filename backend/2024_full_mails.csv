Hey SNU!

Get ready to turn some pages and share some thoughts because the English Literary Club is back with another Book Club meet! Whether you're a seasoned reader or curious about diving into the world of books, everyone is welcome.

Join us on 30th July 2025!
Time: 1:30pm - 3:30pm

Whether you want to spill your hot takes or just vibe with some fun banter, we've got you. No book? No biggie! Bring your friends, your imaginative thoughts and aspects, and your love for good stories; we promise you'll leave with a new read (or five) on your list *wink wink*

Let's make this an afternoon full of great stories, fun discussions, and memorable moments:)

P.S. This event is open to students of all years!

How do I navigate this landscape and do what is best for me?

If you have had or see yourself having these questions in the future - we welcome you to our session ""Internship & Beyond"", hosted by @ABDULLAH SHERIFF<mailto:abdullah21110220@SNUCHENNAI.EDU.IN>, a 4th year AI & DS student at SNUC, on Wednesday, 12 February 2025 between 1 PM and 3:15 PM.
